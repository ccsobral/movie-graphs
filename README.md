# MovieGraphs

A learning project to create a website that generates visualisations from the [IMDB database](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/).

The current stack is Flask+React+SQlite.
Still quite barebones and not deployed anywhere, so if you want to give it a go you'll have to clone the repo and test it locally!
Currently in the process of porting the database to Postgres so I can give deploying to Heroku a try.
